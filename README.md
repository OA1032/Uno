# Uno - Card Recognition Project

# This project was completed using a windows machine and compatability has not been checked on otheer systems such as Linux and MacOS.

The task: - 

Write code for recognising cards from the game UNO. The program should be able to receive input
either from 1) file or 2) a standard camera, and identify cards in the image or frame (one at a time).
You can implement specific computer vision code for recognising some features algorithmically, but
you are encouraged to use more general code based on machine learning techniques.
You can use any function from OpenCV or from libraries included in the Anaconda Python distribution.
Keep in mind that sometimes implementing a function yourself can be faster / easier than making
something external work as you wish. If you find useful information / examples on the web, please
cite appropriate references, including repository pages.
Include an option (or alternative code) for running the program on saved files rather than camera
stream. Please submit all images used to train and test the system. To start, you can use the images
provided in the file images.zip.
The code should easily run on a standard platform. Any important information related to code
execution, user interface, help, etc. has to be included in a readme file.

# Currently the ML model can only recognise the number 4 and 6 

# Execution 

In order to use this program you must: - Run the Notebook cells from top to bottom 

# Download the folder and the necessary dependecies then run the cells from top to bottom

# Right now only colour recognition has been implemented on video.

Install the necessary dependencies using your command window.
